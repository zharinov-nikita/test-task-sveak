                I find the simplicity of the stack brilliant. It makes me to
                think now, to which extent, the industry nowadays simply suffers
                from a mix of lack of knowledge, CV driving design and big

                companies out there could just use a classic LAMPish kinda stack
                managed by 3 or 4 dudes?
